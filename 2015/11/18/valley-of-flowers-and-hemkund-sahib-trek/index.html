Having completed a quick trek to Roopkund in Dussehara vacations, I
hoped to do another in Deepawali. I had no plans of going home from
Noida in vacations. Kiran was also in Gurgaon itself. This time if we
took one day leave from office, we could have 5 days to do something. I
proposed going to Joshimath and doing some of treks among Kauri
Pass(Curzon Trail), Hemkund Sahib and Valley Of flowers over there.
Though Valley of flowers and Hemkund Sahib were already closed by then
for the winter season. Since we were only two, we decided to minimize
the expense using bus travel instead cab.\
\
There were very few buses on the route due to Deepawali that day.  We
managed our way to Joshimath by changing buses and eventually booking a
cab from Karnaprayag. It was night when we arrived Joshimath. To start
trekking for Valley Of Flowers &amp; Hemkund Sahib early morning, it would
have been better if we stayed in Govind ghat that night. The cab driver
was asking for a lot for Govind ghat so we had to stay in Joshimath and
went to Govind ghat next morning.\

\
After asking about the route, we left Govind ghat around 8 in morning.
Govind ghat is situated at the confluence of rivers Alaknanda and
Lakshman Ganga. The route going through Bhyundar valley is well paved
and goes through a dense forest with Bhyundar Ganga on the right side.
After 3-4 hours walk we reached Bhyundar village.\

  Along Bhyundar village to Ghangharia
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
\
\
\
There was no one in the village except one shop and 3-4 labours working
on a home. Having our lunch we enquired upon further trail ahead. The
shopkeeper told us that there is absolutely no one beyond this point in
Ghangharia or Hemkund Sahib and everything is closed. He also warned us
about the bears and leopards in the area and gave us 2 crackers and some
kerosene to light up fire in night.\
After getting few chapatis packed with pickle, soon we left for
Ghangharia. On our way, two dogs tagged along us after getting lured by
Kiran with biscuits.\

\
Walking through the dense forest, it was past 2 P.M. when we reached
Ghangharia.\
<div style="text-align: left;">

</div>

This is a significant place along this trek with lots of houses along
the both sides of street; but everything was closed. It gave the whole
place an eerie appearance. After hiding our bags in the gallery of a
rest house, we left for Valley of Flowers.\

  Towards Valley Of Flowers From Ghangharia,\
  The Pushpawati river gorge
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
The trek goes through the dense forest on left side and Pushpawati river
gorge on the right. The Pushpawati river joins Bhuyandar Ganga near
Ghangharia to form Lakshman Ganga.\
\
\
The dogs chased grey langurs herds whenever they see them. Climbing our
way after crossing Pushpawati river, and walking through the dense
forests with some snow along the trail; we reached Valley of Flowers.\

  Valley of Flowers in mid November
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
The flora in the valley was completely dried except few green patches
here and there. We roamed inside the valley enjoying the view and
clicking pictures.\

After some walk inside the valley, we rested near the grave of Joan
Margaret Legge (1885 - 1939) who died while collecting samples here. The
sun was about to set, so we turned back towards Ghangharia. It was
completely dark when we reached there.\
\
\
\

\
\
We picked some woods from the street and lit up a fire with the help of
kerosene. Sitting there, the dogs occasionally barked and ran along the
street. Kiran feared that something is around and tried to look towards
the way these dogs ran with torch. We only had 6 chapatis to eat. I
suggested to eat next morning for breakfast as we needed enough energy
to climb Hemkund Sahib. Kiran agreed to it and suggested to share our
chapatis with the dogs dutifully protecting us in the night. After few
hours of warming ourselves with fire, we decided to get some sleep. I
kept the fire burning and pitched our tents in the gallery of the rest
house. Dogs kept barking and running all night.\

  The footsteps
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After sharing our breakfast with dogs, we started for Hemkund Sahib. It
is a continuous 6 km climb till the top. After 3 kms, treeline ends and
the path was snowy. The bridge on the way was disassembled so we found
an alternate route nearby to go further. After the bridge there are
stairs and there also is an alternate way. The stairs were steep and
completely covered with snow but the alternate path is longer and not so
steep. There was snow everywhere. After crossing the nullah, when I
started on the stairs, I noticed foot steps of some big animal which
walked before us on that path. Kiran found the path slippery and decided
to take the alternate route. I climbed the stairs cautiously, wondering
if some bear is waiting for me above. Later, I was assured that this
could not be the case as the dogs went ahead and waited for me at the
end of stairs. Kiran continued negotiating the snow, while I reached the
gurudwara. After few mins, Kiran reached there and meanwhile I roamed
around the serene Homkund lake taking pictures with my mobile which
still retained it's juice in airplane mode. With the gentle breeze, the
crystal clear rippling water of the lake was making sounds. We sat there
on a stone by the lake for few minutes and watched around. The dogs were
lying on the snow basking in the sun. Kiran wondered if they were very
tired and are sleeping.\

  The Homkund Lake

\
Around 11 AM, started trekking back for Govind ghat. It was a long way
ahead and we both were hungry. We picked our bags up from Ghangharia
from where we stayed last night and continued the descent. We talked
about having big lunch at Bhyundar. The shopkeeper was waiting for us;
when we we reached there in noon. After lunch and little rest in
Bhyundar, we returned the kerosene and the crackers which we didn't use.
It was necessary to reach Govind Ghat by evening, if we wanted to have
dinner and stay in Joshimath. Around 6 PM, when we reached Govind Ghat
it was dark. With some luck, we managed to catch a jeep coming from
Badrinath.\
\
We still had a day left after these two trek days. Kauri pass was at
least 28 km one way which I didn't think could be managed in the
remaining time. Next day we ended our trip after visiting Badrinath
temple and stayed overnight in Joshimath.\
