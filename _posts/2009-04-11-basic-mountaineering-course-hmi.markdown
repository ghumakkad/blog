[Himalayan Moutaineering Institute](http://www.hmi-darjeeling.com/) is one of the premier institutes in the field of mountaineering in India. 
This is also the first mountaineering institute established in India. 
It was setup in 1954 by the first prime minister Pandit Jawahar Lal Neharu on proposal of Tenjing Norgay ( One of the First Everest Summiteer with Sir Edmund Hillary on 29th May 1953.) 
After the successful summit of the peak he wished to establish an institute to train the budding mountaineers which was accepted by the prime minister.The institute is located on Jawahar Parbat, Darjeeling, West Bengal. Apart from this there are also other institutes which are famous which includes [Nehru Institute of mountaineering](http://www.nimindia.net/), Uttar Kashi, Uttarakhand and [Atal Bihari Vajpayee institute Of Mountaineering and Allied Sports](http://www.adventurehimalaya.org/index.asp) , Manali, Himachal Pradesh.

H.M.I. offers Basic, Advance and Methods Of Instruction Course in the field of Mountaineering. These courses are held in the month of October,
November, December, March, April and May. Being heavily subsidized, the
fee charged is very nominal INR 4000 for Indian citizens
and SAARC
countries. It is USD 700 for
foreign nationals. The fees includes the accommodation, fooding.
Institute also provides you the equipments and the warm clothes for all
courses. Duration for this basic course is 4 weeks.

Basic Mountaineering
Course

I did my BMC in March
'09. The course was divided into four phases :
(a) Acclimatisation &
theoretical training in around Darjeeling -05days
 (b) Trekking (approach
to the base camp (14,600ft) and return) - 07days
 (c) Field
Training(above Base Camp) -14 days
 (d) Administration and
Graduation ceremony – 02 days.

Phase I
: Acclimatisation & Theoretical Training

I
arrived at HMI, Darjeeling (avg. altitude 7000 ft.) on 3rd of March '09,
and was allotted a room which was constructed in the Swiss style and can
accommodate 8 students. In the evening we were made aware of the rules
and regulations of the institute. Our training was to be started from
the next day with morning PT. We had to do the jogging in ascents and
descents of Darjeeling for about 5 km and this will be our daily routine
for the Phase I. After PT, students will have their breakfast and then
we had classes of Rock Climbing (both practical and theory at the rock
faces: Tenzing Rock, Gombu Rock, New Face) and sometimes on the
artificial walls (Indoor and outdoor).

classes also includes lectures on Knots, Ropes, Introduction and use of
mountaineering equipments, Glaciers, Himalayas, Mountain Hazards.
Equipments like harness set,
[carabiners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carabiner), rope, warm
clothes, rucksack, crampons, snow shoes,
[mittens](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mitten), water bottle, Tiffin
box etc. were allotted within few days. Students were randomly divided
into different ropes(groups) of 6. Seniors(in my case military
personnel) among us were made the rope leaders. My rope instructor was
Kushang Sanghe Sherpa. Students were made to practice to trek for 2 -3
days with the load before going to Phase II. On the last day of Phase I,
we were allowed to go outside the campus to buy some necessary things
etc. like sunglasses, raincoats, etc.

**Students coming to HMI :**
In my batch there were 66 people in which at least 25 of them were from
military (Army, Navy and Air force) and most of remaining were from our
North eastern part of India or Nepal. I was the only one from North.
Many of the north eastern people pursue the course so as to get a job in
this field.


Phase II :
Trekking (approach to the base camp t 14,600ft and return)

We started to
[Yuksom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuksom) (literal meaning: meeting
place of three lamas) which is also the first capital of Sikkim, located
at 5840 ft., with our Instructors by bus. Being at
the head of the [Khangchendzonga National
Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khangchendzonga_National_Park) and as the
base camp for trekking to Mt. [Khangchendzonga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khangchendzonga), we stayed
there in tents and started our trek the next day. Entering into this
region requires permission and other formalities.

  Kitchen at Bakhim
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We
started to trek early morning and
reached [Bakhim](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_a6waoCwj6gw/Sd_buw4MtII/AAAAAAAADZQ/Wgn76Wy_FZQ/s800/100_3586.JPG)
(literal meaning : home of bamboos, at 9000 ft.) at about 2 o'clock

and this was about 13
kms.  

By
the time we reached Bakhim, HMI mess staff were already there and our
meal was ready. After having food, we rested there in forest rest house.
Next day we were taken to a small village Tsokha(about 11000 ft. ) for
acclimatisation. They say that if you work at higher altitudes and sleep
at lower altitude you will acclimatise well and fast. There are some
small shops where you can buy something to eat like chips, biscuits,
cold drink, tea etc. 

After staying there for a
while, we returned back to Bakhim and next morning we moved
to [Dzongari](http://www.east-himalaya.com/sikkim/dzongri.htm) (literal
meaning: meeting place of man and mountain gods, at 13220 ft.) via
Phedang which was
about 11 kms.

We pitched
our tents to stay there in the night while our female course mates were
made to stay in the trekking huts. From here we started feeling the
effect of high altitudes. Trees are now converted to bushes and some
people started getting headaches including me, first sign of AMS (acute
mountain sickness). The only remedy was to drink more and more water
since we dehydrate much at high altitudes. In the evening we went for
acclimatisation in surrounding hills ropewise with our rope instructors
where we were introduced to surrounding peaks and places. There was a
frozen stream of water nearby which gets covered with ice at night so we
didn't have water problems. The mess crew always reaches in advance to
provide meal and tea at time. Next day we started our final trek of 13
kms. via Dzongari Pass to Chaurikhang (grazing place of Yaks, 14600
ft.), HMI Base Camp. In between we were provided tea at Beak Bari (a
place 3 kms before Base Camp) which is all the way down (more than 1000
ft.) from Dzongari pass which is itself at 14600ft. Here one can feel
the effect of low atmospheric pressure. Another trek route shoots from
Dzongari pass which goes to [Goecha
La](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goecha_La) (more 17000 ft.) near the
feet of Kanchendzonga.

  MI Room @ HMI Base Camp
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At base camp we stayed in the
hut which was gifted to HMI by
[TISCO](http://www.tatasteel.com/). MOI (method of instruction)
students were staying in the tents. There was a separate hut for girls.
We found our allotted space in the hut and laid down our mats for the
next 15 days training.

Phase III : Field
Training(above Base Camp) -14 days


When we
reached Base Camp, the weather was clear and there was no sign of
snowfall but it started snowing just after an hour. We were enjoying the
snow and meal was ready by 1600 hrs. We were intimated about the rules
and regulations at the base camp same day and told to rest since we were
going to have busy and tough schedule starting from
tomorrow.

Next day we have to go
to [Rathong glacier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rathong_Glacier)
which was approx 4 km from the base camp for our training on
ice.

 We started at 0800 hrs.
On the first day we were introduced to the surroundings and nearby peaks
etc. and how to walk with crampons by our rope instructors. It started
snowing heavily while we were practicing. This kind of weather pattern
continued for next 15 days. Snowing starts around 1000 hrs and continued
till late night. For the next 15 days, all we can see was the whiteness
everywhere and inches of snow. Weather was clear only in the early
morning and it was fascinating to see the golden sunrise in those snow
covered mountains. Snow when pressed between ground and shoes (Koflach
snow boots) becomes very slippery making walking very difficult. You
have to be very careful while walking on snow especially on the glacier
moraine (mass of staggered rocks and boulders)

  Training at ice wall
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We were provided with tea biscuit after the training on the
glacier (thanks to the mess crew). We returned to the base camp in that
heavy snow fall. It was hazy everywhere. Many people were frightened to
see such a view as there was a long slippery way to go. We were told
that such are the conditions one might face during any expedition, so
have to get acquainted with it and so we did. Red flags were used to
mark the way for the trainees to the base camp which were picked back
while returning. After return to the camp, we had our meal and after a
little rest we had a theory class about the equipments used. These were
few new equipments which are used in snow and ice craft. Live
demos of usage of these equipments were given by
our instructors in some of the theory classes.  This was our routine for the next 15
days.

The water there was ice
cold and was stored in tanks for washing purposes which freeze in the
nights. You have to break the thick layer of ice to get the water from
tank. We were provided with 3 ltrs. of hot drinking water every day
apart from several other hot drinks to prevent the
dehydration.

For the next days we
were trained in Ice climbing with the help of crampons and ice axe,
Rescue techniques( self-arrest with ice axe, rescue with pulleys),
Knots, use of equipments, rappelling, Jumaring, and many more. There
were theory classes on Mountain hazards and prevention (by the Institute
doctor ). During the course many of our course mates caught AMS, some
injured their ankles and were sent back.

  Our Rope at the summit of Mt. Renok
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 On
the second last day of the base camp we went for the altitude gain to a
nearby peak (Mt. Renok) which was about 15, 500 ft... This was an
amazing and thrilling experience. We didn't stay there much because
there was not much space on the peak and we have to leave the way for
other ropes.
On this day we also had
our special meal (which is also called badakhana, a military ritual
which I've seen being observed in [NCC](http://nccindia.nic.in/)camps
before) . 




Some slow walkers were
told to start back a day before since they may take 3 days to cover the
return trek. We were told that they will join us in Yuksom. Trekking
back also was not easy as the route was very slippery and we were
falling all the way. But we were very happy like we were being freed
from jail. The snow ended after Phedang (a place between Dzongari and
Bakhim ) The people were filled with energy and they were moving very
fast. After being at the altitude of base camp for so many days the
return trek felt so easy that some of us were literally running. We
covered the return trek in 2 days. On the first day we trekked till
Bakhim which was of 2 days while coming. Next day early morning we
joined them in Yoksum. We returned to HMI by bus from
Yoksum.

Phase IV :  Administration and Graduation ceremony – 02
days

After returning to the campus we had
our written examination which was very easy for literates. There were
few people who were not well versed with reading and writing, though
very good at climbing. The written examination was followed by the rope
wise interview with the principal. We were asked about the
experience we had and our feedback and suggestions we wanted to offer
about the course and the facilities provided. Also, there were individual
competitions
like[](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_a6waoCwj6gw/Sd_h8-t-5xI/AAAAAAAADoA/VZwUKtdPp3s/s800/IMG_2040.JPG)[sports

  Coursemates graduated from HMI
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graduation ceremony was held on the last day and we were awarded HMI
batches by the [Nawang Gombu
Sherpa](http://imagingeverest.rgs.org/Units/58.html) ( several times
Everest summiteer ) for the successful completion of our course. We were
told that our certificates will be sent within few months along with our
grades. It is important to have A grade to get recommended for Advance
Mountaineering Course. For [gallery of pictures of the 270th
BMC](https://plus.google.com/photos/107341399191243523385/albums/5323175315045607857).

Update: In 2014, I got chance to go for AMC
(Advance Mountaineering Course) from NIM, Uttarkashi. [Here is what I
experienced.](http://mountaineeringguide.blogspot.in/2014/10/advance-mountaineering-course-nehru.html)
