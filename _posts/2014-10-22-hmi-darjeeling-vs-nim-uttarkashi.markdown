This is one of those questions which comes to mind when going for a mountaineering course in India. 
Having done my [BMC from HMI]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2009-04-11-basic-mountaineering-course-hmi %}) and [AMC from NIM]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2014-10-14-advance-mountaineering-course-nim %}), I got some idea about the training in these two institutes. 
Here is what I thought of HMI and NIM in terms of :

#### Organization

Both HMI and NIM are run by Ministry of Defence, GOI in collaboration
with respective state governments. So, in terms and objective and
philosophy and in training programs both are same. In my personal
opinion, the past principals and the present principal (Col. Ajay
Kothiyal) of NIM  seem more active and devoted to the institute. NIM
played major role in rescue and rehabilitation work in the time 2013
Uttarakhand disaster. This was also widely covered in media.

#### Rock Climbing area

The biggest asset of NIM is that it has a vast rock climbing area in
Tekhla. In this area, there are variety of rock features of varying
degree of difficulty. Trainees have plenty of time to practice rock
climbing techniques on these features. In HMI, there weren't much rock
faces to climb. For rock climbing, it has Tenzing Rock and Gombu Rock in
the outskirts of Darjeeling. They try to compensate this later in the
course with the big boulders available around the base camp. So rest of
the training in rock craft happens in Base camp area of HMI which is in
Chaurikhang, Sikkim.

HMI's artificial wall seem definitely bigger than those in NIM and
everything else is more or less same. Maybe because HMI installed these
walls after NIM.

#### Glacier for training of ice climbing techniques

The Rathong glacier, training area of HMI has lot more ice walls to
practice than the Dokrani glacier of NIM. Both the glaciers are receding
very fast and trainees need to walk to the training area everyday which
takes some time and energy. Dokrani glacier of NIM, has lot of moraine
covering the ice walls and around the snout of the glacier where most of
the training happens there isn't much blue ice. I saw plenty of smoking
blue ice in Rathong glacier. It has big fields of blue ice around the
training area. Although advance courses in NIM goes to a different
training area upwards in the glacier for 2 days for their advance ice
craft which has sufficient ice walls and relatively cleaner ice.
Overall, in terms of ice walls available on which we get to train, HMI
has lot better than NIM. Maybe in future, NIM may think of to change the
base camp to get better area for ice craft. It would be more appropriate
for NIM, to move the base camp to the place where they have their
advance base camp.

#### Technical Equipments and Training

It was unanimously established among my course-mates of AMC who did
their BMC from HMI that NIM provides more and advance technical
equipments than HMI. In case of HMI advance techniques or use of advance
equipments are mostly demonstrated by instructors but in NIM you'll get
a chance to practice with/on them.

#### Trek to Base Camp

It is a fact that, to reach the base camp; the trek in HMI is tougher
than that in NIM. In both institutes, it takes 3 days to reach base
camp. The trek in HMI goes on relatively higher altitude than NIM and
are longer on everyday. Situated on higher altitude than NIM, the base
camp of HMI offers more splendid view of surrounding peaks.

#### Accomodation

The hostel of HMI and NIM are both well maintained and have all the
required facilities. If you are pursuing basic course, you get to stay
in barrack made of metal sheets and wood in HMI. It's all tent in NIM
for both basic and advance courses outside the campus.

#### Location of Institute

In my opinion, roaming in and around Darjeeling has better experience
than Uttarkashi. So, location wise, HMI wins and it also has bigger area
with a zoo in it's campus.
