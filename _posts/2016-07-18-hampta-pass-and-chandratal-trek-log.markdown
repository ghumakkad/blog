I was exploring some extended weekend treks as my office colleagues also
wanted to come along on my next trek. After searching and negotiating a
lot, no agreeable trek couldn't be decided and now that I have to travel
solo, I finally decided to go for Hampta Pass and Chandratal.. Hampta
pass trek starts from Manali, Himachal Pradesh. It is a small pass on
Pir Panjal range of Himalayas, between Lahaul and Kullu valley in
Himachal Pradesh. Vertical rock walls, water falls, hanging glaciers,
tiny lakes, peaks rising above 6000 m are main characteristics of this
trek. I was very excited about this trek because I was finally getting
another chance to see Chandratal.\
\
\
Kiran was also in town and ready for a weekend trek. We left Delhi on
Thursday, 14 July so that we had an extra day before next week starts.
Bus to Manali was running late and we reached there around 11A.M. After
having heavy dinner around noon, we took a cab for Jobra. It takes an
hour and forty hairpin bends to arrive at Jobra. It was around 2 PM when
we reached there. We left immediately, as we had planned to reach Balu
Ka Ghera on our first day of trek and it was already late. It had rained
earlier in the day and path was slippery till Chika village.\

\
In few hours of trek, crossing few streams we reached Jwara. Clouds were
all around us and visibility was very poor.\
\
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div>

Balu ka ghera was still like an hour far from Jwara. There wasn't much
daylight left and it could rain anytime. We decided to pitch our tents
in Jwara. In the backdrop, we had a vertical rocky cliff with a nice
view of waterfall. There was a shop in Jwara from where we got ourselves
nice dinner for the night.\

It was Saturday, June 16th. We started for Balu ka Ghera early morning
next day. it was all misty from the beginning which was giving the whole
valley a mystic look.\

\
It started raining heavily when we reached Balu Ka Ghera. We got 4
parathas packed from there to have lunch later in the day. After more
than an hour wait in Balu Ka Ghera, when the rain didn't stop; we
prepared ourselves to walk in rain.\

\
There was a Dutch couple, whom we had met in Jwara. They also arrived
Balu Ka Ghera when we were about to leave. We started from Balu Ka Ghera
together. They were thinking of returning back from the pass but we had
plans to go further. Before the ascent to pass starts, there is a big
lake where we bid them goodbye and continued our journey.\

\
In heavy rain, the stream beside us was ferocious which actually
accompanied us all along the trek in the valley. After crossing the some
boulders, we reached the glacier. In such low visibility, it was getting
difficult to find our way forward. Kiran was incessantly asking whether
we are on the right path or not. I followed the tracks of mules on the
glacier and reached the plateau. It was real cloudy and it seemed that I
had lost my way here. We had a pack biscuit there and decided to look
closely for tracks. It seemed, that we had to go back and follow the
track more closely. On our left was a vertical rocky cliff.\

  The valley, clouds ahead on the pass
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
It was there when I heard some sound of mules walking somewhere nearby.
I rushed towards the noise, though between so dense clouds, it was being
difficult to figure out. Following the mule sound, I heard voice of a
man controlling the mules. We shouted and asked whether anybody is
there. The mules were gone and lost in the clouds by then. After few
minutes, someone replied to our hello. When we rushed towards the sound,
it was the same dutch couple with their guide. The lady told me, that
they decided to cross the pass same day. The lady was was kind enough to
offer us chocolates. We were just few meters away from the trail, but
without their help we definitely would've gone in the wrong direction.
This could've lost us at least few precious hours. We were actually few
meters away from the trail. It's just that the trail makes an unusual
bend towards left while going up at the highest point of trek which we
would have easily figured out in clearer sky.\

  Towards Shiagoru From Hampta Pass
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With them, we started our descent to Shiagoru. It's a steep descent
which was little slippery due to rains. The rain was little slow at this
part of valley (Lahaul). If it was a normal day, we could've had a nice
view of Indrasan peak which was right to us while climbing down. We were
descending to Lahaul Valley. The arrangements were already there for the
night in Shiagoru for the Dutch couple. We decided to trek further down
to Chhatru. Kiran had to go back next day for Delhi on Sunday to join
office. The stream in Shiagoru had grown strong due to continuous rain
that day. It's a flat area fed from glacier; it wasn't deep but
certainly was cold. Having crossed the stream with our hands joined, we
took off for Chhatru. From Shiagoru to Chhatru, it's a long walk but
easy descent. The sun was about to set when we reached Chhatru roadhead.
Chhatru is on the way to Kaza from Manali. We pitched our tents, and
were invited for dinner by trek organizers from Bikat adventures who
were also camped there.\

Early morning, we had a quick breakfast in Chhatru. There were few truck
drivers having tea. When they were about to leave, I asked them for a
drop to Batal. I started my journey ahead with them after saying goodbye
to Kiran who was waiting for a conveyance that he can get to Manali.
Chhatru to Batal isn't very far, but due to road conditions it was
already afternoon when I reached Batal. After having lunch in Batal, I
enquired for the directions to Chandratal. People suggested me to go to
Kunzum pass and start a near downhill trek from there. I took there
advice, as it was clear that the road from Batal to Chandratal was only
preferred for vehicles. Those truck drivers were still there having
lunch. I joined them again when they left for Kaza.\
\
It was raining in Kunzum la, when I reached there. There was no one who
could tell me the way to Chandratal, though there was a board with
signboard of Chandratal. I just decided to follow the path behind the
board. It was well laid trail till I reached a point from where I had a
view of valley. At this point the trail ended and I had nowhere to go. I
could see tents far in the valley, but there was a very steep descent. I
tried to go down that path, but had to to turn back as it was very
slippery. When many attempts to find a better way to the valley failed I
had to retrace the path back so as to find some alternative way. I was
sure that I was on right path to Chandratal. After few meters of
travelling back, there was a trail sharp left climbing towards the
nearby hill. I took that and climbed the hill to see around. From there,
I could see the trail going further inside the valley. Thanking god, I
trotted down the trail. All along the way, the weather was clear and I
had a nice view of valley and Chandra river valley.\

  Chandra Valley
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
Finally, the Chandratal was in sight. I aimed to reach Chandratal with
some buffer time to explore. It was not allowed to camp there but there
were many people camping around Chandratal. There was no authority to
control this. While trekking from Kunjum La to Chandratal, I did not
find any kiosk or office where one could find any kind camping permits
etc. The visitors of Chandratal, mostly were with some trek organization
on four wheelers with exceptions of few bikers.\

  Chandra Taal
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\
Despite that, Chandratal was still very beautiful, clean and peaceful.
The small stream emanating from Chandratal and a wooden bridge looks
like a setting from a fairy tale. I sat there around half an hour. When
sun had set, I turned back towards Batal road looking for a place to
camp. Most of the good places nearby were completely occupied by private
organizations which was little disheartening. Anyhow I was able to find
a place to camp besides some Paragon camping site. Next day returned
back to Batal. On the way to Batal from Chandratal, I was offered a lift
by a jeep accompanying bikers. In Batal, I was able get hold of a jeep
going towards Manali. Buses are not very reliable on this route. The
driver of the jeep was in his teens and he was determined to reach
Manali by lunch time. By afternoon, I was in Manali where I had lunch
and explored the market until it was time for bus to Delhi.\
