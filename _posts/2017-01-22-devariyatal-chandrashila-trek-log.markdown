After my last trek to Hampta Pass, I couldn’t get any leave from office
due to work and had lost precious trek months of August, September and
October. It was towards end of November, when I finally got a chance to
plan a trek.\
One of my office colleague, Shweta had been asking to go on a trek. She
was eager to see what a trek would be like. I was little skeptical,
since she had no prior experience of trek.

I had not been to Tungnath before, so I chose to trek to Chandrashila
starting from Devariyatal via Rohini Bugyal. It was also suitable trek
in a way that it is not difficult for new trekkers.

We started from New Delhi to Haridwar on Friday, 25th Nov’16 via train
and we reached Haridwar at 4 in the morning. The bus stand was near by
so we walked towards Bus stand soon after having tea at Railway station
to catch a bus to Joshimath, Chamoli. After 6 hours of journey, we
reached Rudraprayag. From there we took a cab to Sari village (Starting
point of trek) as there aren’t frequent transport options towards
Ukhimath road. Sari is located near Ukhimath in Rudraprayag district.

First day of trek towards Devariyatal from Sari
\
<div id="bf87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" name="bf87"
style="--baseline-multiplier: 0.179; font-family: medium-content-serif-font, Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 21px; letter-spacing: -0.003em; line-height: 1.58; margin-top: 38px;">

We reached the village Sari around 2 PM. We started off to Devariyatal
immediately. Trek to Devariyatal is roughly 3 km climb from this
village. In little more than an hour, we reached Devariyatal . There
weren’t many people camping that day. In fact, there were only two tents
pitched except ours. The lake Devariyatal is beauty of it’s own.

A clear view of peak like Mt. Chaukhambha, and reflections of
surrounding trees in it’s calm water could hardly be matched by any
other camping site. It is also unmatched in terms of it’s distance from
nearest civilization with Sari village being just 2 km downhill. We put
our bags and tents nearby the lake and decided to take stroll along the
boundary of lake. The sun was about to set, and the surrounding peaks
were getting a golden hue.

We rushed to a place to get a best possible view. We couldn’t have
enough of it. It felt like as if it has been a long time since I had
been away from mountains. Shweta also was very happy to be here. In her
words, this place can make a person breathe a new life in themselves.

Before dark, we pitched our tents. The sky was soon filled with stars
where we sat under in appreciation. After some time, we went to a nearby
shop for dinner. There while having dinner, we asked about the route to
Chandrashila via Rohini Bugyal from the shopkeeper. He told us to take a
guide as there was very less or no water along the route and there was
nobody going through that route these days. I had never taken a guide
before but this time was different. I needed to be more responsible than
before. I was not sure, how easy this was going to be for somebody new
to trekking. We may have to keep on trekking if we couldn’t find water
along the way till we find any. Shweta was ready to accept these
difficulties. After talking to others in the shop, it was clear to us
that water sources along the way had dried up and we may face
difficulties because of that. Everybody except us, were going to
Tungnath from Chopta which was too mainstream for me. While having
dinner, I asked if I could get a guide for the rest of the trek. The
shopkeeper told us that he knew someone in the village, who would take
INR 1000 per day and we also have to rent a tent and sleeping bag for
him. We decided to think over it in night and went back to our tents.

Chaukhambha, early morning at Devariyatal
\
<div id="c57e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" name="c57e"
style="--baseline-multiplier: 0.179; font-family: medium-content-serif-font, Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 21px; letter-spacing: -0.003em; line-height: 1.58; margin-top: 38px;">

We woke up early and packed our bags. There was a hut of forest guard
nearby who gave us the required camping permits. We were ready by 7 AM.
What mattered to me the most was to complete the trek without any
unnecessary difficulties. While having breakfast I asked the shopkeeper
to arrange for the guide he was talking about last night. Meanwhile he
was on his way to Devariyatal from home (Sari village), we arranged for
his tent and sleeping bag along with some utensils and food items which
will be required in coming days. Being extra careful with water, we
bought some extra bottles in case we didn’t find any water on the way.
Our guide, Umendra Singh Bhatt, turned up almost after an hour and we
started as soon as he arrived. Our first stop was Rohini Bugyal and the
trail leading to Rohini Bugyal was not long. It ascends moderately till
Jhandi Dhar (a ridge with a flag at the top) and passes through a dense
jungle thereafter.

On our right side, we constantly had a view of Sari village. Contrary to
what was told, we encountered running streams on our way. After Jhandi
Dhar, the jungle becomes dense and beautiful.

Every now and then I couldn’t stop myself from halting and clicking
pictures on the way. We easily reached Rohini Bugyal in 4–5 hours. We
decided to halt for the day and the place had few abandoned huts. People
living there had left the place not more than a month ago. There was a
small stream of water near the place where we decided to camp. Umendra
collected some dry woods from nearby place and created a makeshift
fireplace with some stones and started to prepare tea. After having tea,
we went around to fetch some more wood for night and cooking.

I was curious to know about the places around, so soon after having tea
and maggi, we went for a stroll. From our location the view of Trishul
peak was blocked by a mountain. Umendra told us that on this mountain,
there is a lake called Bisuri Tal which is a high altitude glacial lake.
I think it may’ve been known as Vasuki Tal originally. From Rohini
Bugyal, a straight trail leads to Bisuri Tal, whereas the trail on the
right with initial ascent and then steep descent goes towards Akash
Kamini stream coming from Chandrashila.

Usually it takes two more days from Rohini Bugyal to reach Bisuri Tal.
Bisuri Tal offers a very close view of Trishul peak and it is one of the
less known treks. If time allowed, I was eager to go on this one as soon
as we complete the Chandrashila trek. There isn’t much information on
Bisuri Tal on internet.\
We roamed around the meadow in the evening and as the sun was about to
set, the cast it was creating on the mountains was giving such a
fascinating view that it was literally a treat to watch. When it was
finally dark, we sat near the fireplace to discuss the next course of
actions and we decided to start early the next day so as to reach
Bhurgali early and continue trekking to Chandrashila after leaving our
heavy rucksacks at the shop whoes owner was Umendra’s friend. With this
plan, next day was going to be little long. It had more ascent than
before. Umendra went to sleep early and we sat there talking near the
fireplace till there was no firewood left. After sometime, with not much
left to do, we went on towards our tents.

We got up early around 6 in the morning and packed our tents and bags.
Umendra had already started preparing tea for all of us. After having
some tea and biscuit, we left Rohini Bugyal to start our last day of the
trek. Past Rohini Bugyal, trail descends steeply towards Akash Kamini
stream. On this descend, Shweta started having problems with her knee
which made her little slow. But she continued anyway and we soon reached
the Akashkamini stream. It originates near the Chandrashila peak. After
walking for around 2 hours we halted near lower Bhurjgali. There were
few abandoned huts around where we stayed for a while and had some
maggi. Umendra seemed to be a very good cook. We both agreed, that we
never had maggi tastier than this. It took nearly three hours for us to
reach Bhurjgali.

From here onwards, this trail merges to the trail coming from Chopta. In
fact Chopta was about a km from here. There was a shop nearby where we
left our rucksacks and had some tea. Soon we left for Tungnath and
Chandrashila. It is well laid path with carved steps and railings etc.
What disappointed me most was the amount of garbage on the way. The task
of collecting garbage on the way became more difficult than any other of
my treks. Umendra was also helping in collecting the garbage. We were
discussing, what could Lord Tungnath offer to those who come and throw
garbage around. In an hour or so, we reached Tungnath, though the temple
was closed for the season. We offered our prayers and roamed around.

There we met other people who had come there from Chopta. We stayed
there for a while and then started ahead for Chandrashila.\
As there was no snow, so it didn’t take much time to reach Chandrashila.
There was a small temple up there. As soon as we reached there, all of
us offered our prayers to the lord and went ahead with watching the
amazing view of mountains. It had been a long time, that I had visited a
place which offers such a panoramic view of mountains peaks. We could
see a complete 180 degree view of majestic peaks of Garhwal. Umendra
told about the various peaks we can see from there and the places
around. I had been to the summit of Mt. DKD-II which could also be seen
from there. Chandrashila also offers a clear view of Mt. Nanda Devi.
From Jaonli to Nanda Devi, every peak was clear to us.

All this time of our stay at Chandrashila, we found ourselves sitting
and watching the peaks around. When we were content enough, we started
our descent towards Bhurjgali. After walking for almost an hour, we
reached Bhurjgali and there we had our lunch and started descending
towards Chopta. From Chopta we took a cab to Sari village which Umendra
had already called. After a drive of almost 40–45 minutes, we reached
Sari, where we stayed for the night before leaving for Haridwar next
morning.
